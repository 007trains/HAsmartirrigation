General:
    add some sort of automation / irrigate every X days counter?

    hOW TO Listen to unit changes from HA?
        Was unable to make that work.
1. Sensor groups
		source validation same as grill buddy
2. UNIT_DEGREES_X --> UnitOfTemperature.CELSIUS
	also do this for Smart IRRIGATION!
3. Refactor language file  (move everything in one file (frontend)) to appease hassfest

Wishlist:
- calculation algorithm: PyEto / PenMon /  ET_calc. See: https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/HAsmartirrigation/issues/127
- scheduler? or just use something like https://github.com/rgc99/irrigation_unlimited?
