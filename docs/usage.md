# Usage

Once Smart Irrigation is installed, the following things will be created in Home Assistant:
- A sidebar panel that you can use to [configure the integration](configuration.md).
- [An sensor entity](usage-entities.md) for [each zone you configured](configuration-zones.md).
- [A couple of services](usage-services.md) to automate tasks.
- [A start event](usage-events.md) that will indicate that irrigation should start to finish before sunrise.
- Together all of these things allow you to write your [automations](usage-automations.md).

Also in this section:
- [Troubleshooting](usage-troubleshooting.md) information.
