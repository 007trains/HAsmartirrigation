# Configuration

You use the Smart Irrigation panel to configure the integration. Make sure you [install](installation.md) it first.

INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE + highlight pages + panel entry


The panel consists of multiple pages:

1. [General](configuration-general.md): use this to configure  update / calculation schedules and other general settings.
2. [Zones](configuration-zones.md): set up the zones in your irrigation system. Each zone is mapped to a sensor group and a module, but multiple zones can use the same sensor group or module.
3. [Sensor groups](configuration-sensor-groups.md): this indicates which sensors or weather service provides what data for our calculations.
4. [Modules](configuration-modules.md): use this page to configure how you want calculations to be done.
