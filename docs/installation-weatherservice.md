- API Key for Open Weather Map (optional). Only required in mode 1 and 3. See [Getting Open Weather Map API Key](https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/HAsmartirrigation#getting-open-weather-map-api-key) below for instructions.

If you use a weather service, make sure your home zone coordinates are set correctly so the data is correct. This is especially true if you set the coordinates manually in the configuration.yaml.

Although we recommend using Open Weather by providing an free API key, you _can_ skip it. Skipping it, however, disables any ability to forecast. If it is disabled you need to use another source, such as your own weather station, exclusively. If you turn it off, you will not be able to use forecasts. Provide an OWM API if you intent to use Open Weather Map for at least part of the weather data, including forecasting. If you enable it the API Key for Open Weather MAP can be changed also like the version you want to use (API 2.5 or 3.0).
